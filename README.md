# Stefanova-CV-Website
This Website is my CV that I just turned into a website, I add some interactivity to this website. This website is made by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I was adding hidden personal data, making a pop-up containing an enlarged image, adding a navigation dropdown bar that could move the user to other content, adding some necessary hover to the buttons and images, and adding a section so the viewer of the website could rate the website and get different output depending on their rating.
